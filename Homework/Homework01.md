1. (not in book) What is HTML? See https://www.w3.org/TR/html40/.
	* Hyper Text Markup Language
	* Three mechanisms to make a network of information resources readily available to the widest possible audiance:
		* A uniform naming scheme for locating resources on the Web (e.g., URIs).
		* Protocols, for access to named resources over the Web (e.g., HTTP).
		* Hypertext, for easy navigation among resources (e.g., HTML).
2. (not in book) What is HTTP? See https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html.
	* Stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.	
	* its a set of rules to tell the browser how to read the HTML
3. What is middleware? See pages 255-256 in the book.
	* The purpose of the ASP.NET Core platform is to receive HTTP requests and send responses to them, which ASP.NET Core delegates
to middleware components. Middleware components are arranged in a chain, known as the request pipeline. 
4. What is URL routing? See pages 282-283 in the book.
	* URL routing allows you to configure an application to accept request URLs that do not map to physical files. A request URL is simply the URL a user enters into their browser to find a page on your web site. You use routing to define URLs that are semantically meaningful to users and that can help with search-engine optimization (SEO).
	
5. What is dependency injection? See pages 255-257 in the book.
	* In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on. These other objects are called dependencies. In the typical "using" relationship the receiving object is called a client and the passed object is called a service.
6. What is model binding? See pages 703-706 in the book.
	* Model binding is a mechanism ASP.NET MVC uses to create parameter objects defined in controller action methods. The parameters can be of any type, from simple to complex ones. It simplifies working with data sent by the browser because data is automatically assigned to the specified model.
7. What are Razor pages?
	* ASP.NET Core Razor Pages is a page-focused framework for building dynamic, data-driven web sites with clean separation of concerns. Based on the latest version of ASP.NET from Microsoft - ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages supports cross platform development and can be deployed to Windows, Unix and Mac operating systems.
8. What is Entiity Framework Core?
	* Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology. EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), enabling . NET developers to work with a database using .
9. What is ASP.NET Core Identity?
	* Is an API that supports user interface (UI) login functionality.
Manages users, passwords, profile data, roles, claims, tokens, email confirmation, and more.
10. What is the ASP.NET Core platform?
	* ASP.NET is a popular web-development framework for building web apps on the .NET platform.
